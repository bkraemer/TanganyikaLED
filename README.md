# TanganyikaLED
This is a compilation of data and code used for a study on night-time, light-based fishing gears in Lake Tanganyika. The main aim of the research associated with the collection of these data was to assess the costs of potential consequences of switching from using kerosene lanterns to various types of LEDs systems in Lake Tanganyika. Our overall aim was 1) to understand factors that influence the adoption of this new LED lighting technology and 2) to determine whether LED systems influence overall fish catch and composition.
